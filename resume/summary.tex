Computer Science student, experience working with 3 early stage startups and extensive education in software engineering, full stack, backend development, and machine learning. I design and code beautifully simple things, and I love what I do. A fast learner with strong time management and multi-tasking skills.  Iâ€™m looking for a company with many exciting challenges, personal development, and the opportunity to forge my own projects. Interested in devising a better problem-solving method for challenging tasks, and learning new technologies.
